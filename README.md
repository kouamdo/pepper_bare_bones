# pepper_bare_bones IA 32 bits


*Kernel from scratch for intel core 32 bits*

My goal is to make OS Kernel that will use in networking and telecommunications research and engineering.


For now, we are still at the initialisation steps, ... :

- Simples boot sectors (First stage and second stage)
- Apic and IOAPIC
- Pagination and segmentation functionnality
- Memory Allocation
- Process management
- I/O management
