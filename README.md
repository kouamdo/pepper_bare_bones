*Kernel from scratch for intel core 32 bits*

My goal is to make OS that will use for performance networking research and engineering.


For now, we are still at the initialisation steps, ... :

- Simples boot sectors (First stage and second stage)
- Apic and IOAPIC
- Pagination and segmentation functionnality
- Memory Allocation
- Process management
- I/O management
- Kernel console and monitor for execute some instructions
